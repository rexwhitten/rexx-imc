alpha1.2 6 Aug 1992  - initial release

alpha1.3 17 Sep 1992 - fixes the following problems:

   * Installation instructions too brief and not clear enough
   * Error incorrectly reported on the following code format:
       select
           when a
 	     then ...
 	  when b
 	     then ...
       end
   * Clause tracing did not strip leading tabs.   
   * Special variable SIGL not set on calling an internal routine
   * Second parameter of bitxxx() was required; should be optional
   * pos, lastpos, wordpos gave error when the needle was empty
   * sign('-0') = -1 (should be 0)
   * sign() left extra value on calculator stack, causing surprises
   * subword(" to be or not to be ",7) caused crash; similarly for
     word and wordlength
   * symbol() gave incorrect results;
   * translate(x,"") mistook the empty string for an omitted argument
   * wordindex(string,n) gave non-zero when string contained n-1 words
   * x2d() did not recognise second parameter
   * arg() gave "4", not "2" when arguments were: func(1,2,,)
   * binary strings were too restricted (i.e. a multiple of 8 digits and
     no spaces)
   * "DO for=forever" interpreted FOREVER as reserved
   * PROCEDURE EXPOSE used commas as separators instead of spaces
   * date('U') gave wrong day number
   * Leading and trailing spaces were allowed in hex constants
   * Priorities of implicit concatenation, space operator and unary operators
     were wrong
   * random(n,n) returned error; should return n
   * Memory fault occurred after 63 nested PROCEDURE instructions
   * expression after PUSH and QUEUE was required
   * "rxstack" sometimes exited before giving the stack a chance to catch up;
     after that queued() would slowly rise up to its correct value.
   
beta1.4 13 May 1993 - fixes the following problems:

   * Mathematical function name discrepancy between rxmathfn.c and rxfn.c
     now fixed
   * Intermittent "Routine not found" error when using external functions
     now fixed
   * Case of labels is now preserved in "trace l"
   * "parse var a.b" gave "?.B" when a.b undefined, now gives "A.B"
   * "parse var" now signals to NOVALUE when variable is undefined
   * stem. is now different from stem.""
   * "stem.=5; drop stem.5; say stem. stem.5" now says "5 STEM.5" (did say
     "5 5")
   * Control variable in a loop is interpreted on each pass, and END, LEAVE 
     and ITERATE compare symbol names literally.
   * INTERPRET changed to detect incomplete DO/SELECT blocks
   * SELECT (and WHEN) changed to reject multiple statements in WHEN clauses
   * "do name=expri ..." changed to assign "expr + 0" to "name" instead of
     just "expr".
   * UNTIL conditions are tested before incrementing the control variable
   * WHILE/UNTIL checking "modernised" ;-)
   * "procedure expose (varlist)" implemented
   * Fixed uninitialised char* pointer in rxchars2() which made lines()
     sometimes bomb out with segmentation fault
   * Fixed "Unexpected THEN/ELSE" error report for instructions of form
     "otherwise if (cond) then ..."
   * Amended rxmathfn.exec to use single instructions in WHEN clauses
   * Fixed multiplication to say "Arithmetic Overflow" instead of "Invalid
     whole number" when overflow occurs
   * Fixed stacknum() to report error on too-large exponents - it previously
     stacked an erroneous value instead.
   * Fixed sqrt() to work with argument zero
   * Fixed EXIT instruction to record size of new calculator stack
     (previous code occasionally caused hard-to-trace memory crashes)
   * chars(file) calls stat to return the size of file when it is not open
   * chars() now takes into account characters buffered by stdio
   * NUMERIC settings saved across function calls
   * "parse numeric" now works
   * Changed the sqrt() function in rxmathfn.exec
   * Fixed formatting to obey 2*DIGITS rule for small numbers
   * Fixed format() to obey 2*expt rule, also to round the number on input
   
REXX/imc-beta-1.5 4.00 25 Jun 1993 has the following changes:

   * Fixed two erroneous source lines which choke sensitive compilers
   * Distinguished between AIX cc and AIX gcc in the Makefile
   * made "do 3=i" an error instead of a counted loop
   * made "a==4" an error instead of a command
   * Message 15 last word changed from "constant" to "string"
   * '414243'x(3) is now a function call (was abuttal)
   * allowed tab characters in hex and binary strings
   * implemented "drop (list)"
   * Added STUFF_STACK preprocesor symbol
   * Fixed traceback and related things so that, for instance, running
     main.exec, where main, foo and bar are as follows:

     main.exec                   foo.exec                          bar.exec
   
     /* call an OK program */    /* call an erroneous program */   /* error */
     call foo                    say "Entered FOO"                 return a+b
                                 say bar()
                                 say "Leaving FOO"
                                 return
			       
     produces the following output:

     Entered FOO
         2 +++  return a+b
     Error 41 running /tmp/bar.exec, line 2: Bad arithmetic conversion
         3 +++  say bar()
     Error 50 running /tmp/foo.exec, line 3: Error in called routine
         2 +++ call foo
     Error 50 running /tmp/main.exec, line 2: Error in called routine

     whereas only the first four lines would previously have been displayed.
     Similarly, traceback is printed for an error in an external routine
     even when the error is trapped in the calling program.

   * Removed the RC messages from error reports such as the above, because
     they were pointless.
   * Changed the format of RC messages from "RC(n)" to "RC=n"
   * Implemented the third parameter of justify()
   * Corrected "parse version" to show a language level as second token
     instead of the interpreter version.
   * Corrected mtest() to keep the old value if realloc fails
   * Rewrote the tokeniser and amended various parts of the interpreter to
     use the new program format
   * Implemented the "name" subkeyword of "signal on"
   * implemented the "failure" and "notready" conditions
   * Added command line option processing
   * Added extra signal handlers to make the interpreter die more cleanly
   * Implemented "call on"
   * Implemented the "condition" builtin function
   * Made "Unexpected '*/'" a separate (nonstandard) error message
   * Trace instructions now ignored in program if interactive tracing is on
   * Implemented "tracefile=" option
   * Improved chars() and lines() for non-open files to get more information
     and raise notready if appropriate.  Improved lines() for persistent
     files to return the correct result (and not just 0 or 1).
   * Deleted ioerr().  RC is no longer set when notready is raised.
   * Fixed the return values of charout() [would sometimes return a null
     string or an incorrect value of 1 if an error occurred].
   * File I/O functions now give error when the file is an empty string.
   * Implemented the stream() function with commands close, fdopen, fileno,
     flush, ftell, open, pclose and popen.
   * Changed rexxtest.exec to use the stream() function instead of all those
     other ones.
   * Changed REXXPATH to REXXIMC and implemented the search so that this
     environment variable is no longer necessary.

REXX/imc-beta-1.5a 4.00 5 Sep 1993 was released to patch the following:

   * Corrected the AIX cc compile flags -O2 and -qchar=signed.
   * Removed extraneous definition of bsearch.
   * Renamed "free" label to satisfy SunOS cc compiler.
   * Corrected an uninitialised variable reference which caused a crash on
     certain function calls.
   * Corrected "storage exhausted" error with startup on AIX.
   * Corrected a bug which caused looping while reporting "Unmatched quote"
     error in certain input files.
   * Corrected an error which left the default filetype blank when the
     source file was standard input or "-s string".
   * Allowed "address ''" and "trace ''" to run without error.
   * Disallowed "call on novalue" and "call on syntax".
   * Added setrc option to aid compatibility with earlier versions.
   * Added -v and -c commandline flags.

REXX/imc-beta-1.6 4.00 29 Apr 1994:  This was released as version 1.59
                                     at the REXX Symposium in Boston.

   * Fixed bug with "a.=3" used when a.3 is exposed (but not a.)
   * '\r' added to the list of space characters allowed in source code
     (for DOS format files).
   * Error for the expression "()" changed from "Invalid expression" to
     "Unexpected )"
   * "parse value with ..." allowed
   * Novalue is no longer trapped in a command entered at interactive trace.
     If for some reason a novalue error does occur during such a command,
     the message says "No-value error on X" instead of "No-value errorX".
   * "do while internal_function()" now works properly
   * The exprw in "do i=1 while exprw" is now evaluated after i is incremented
     (which matters if and only if it involves i).
   * Extra comment terminators are ignored instead of being flagged as an
     error.  This is because "a=3*/*comment*/4" is a legal instruction which
     would have been flagged.
   * The while in "do '1' while=x" is now tokenised.
   * It is no longer an error to have an if...then (...else) instruction at
     the end of the program.
   * It is no longer an error to have a label name starting with a number or
     dot.
   * Labels are no longer allowed in INTERPRETed strings.
   * Labels are clauses (makes tracing easier).
   * b2x and b2d changed to accept binary strings with spaces in them.
   * datatype(string,'X') now returns 0 if string contains leading or trailing
     spaces.
   * Bug fixed which prevented REXX from working when file 0 or 1 was closed
     before invoking it.
   * ADDRESS settings are now saved over function calls.
   * "do until while=3" is now "invalid DO syntax" instead of "invalid
     expression" and is an error on the first pass instead of the second.
   * Rudimentary API implemented featuring:
     RexxStart (no tokenised programs)
     RexxVariablePool (except RXSHV_EXIT and RXSHV_PRIV)
     RexxRegisterSubcomExe/RexxDeregisterSubcom/RexxQuerySubcom
     RexxRegsiterExitExe/RexxDeregisterExit/RexxQueryExit (with exits
        RXCMDHST, RXSIODTR, RXSIOSAY, RXSIOTRC, RXSIOTRD, RXINIEXT and
        RXTEREXT)
     RexxRegisterFunctionExe/RexxDeregisterFunction/RexxQueryFunction.
   * Added error message 45 and made RETURN enforce it.
   * The string returned by PARSE SOURCE is now constant within a program,
     as described in TRL (it used to depend on the current function).
   * Implemented searching of *.rxlib files.
   * Functions are now hashed when found, for faster access next time.
   * Rewrote which() to read directories instead of using access().
   * Implemented "unix program called as a function".
   * Changed the continuation trace prefix to "*,*".
   * Changed the distributed Make file to include the release date.

REXX/imc-beta-1.6a 4.00 18 May 1994:

This was released as version 1.6 two weeks after the Symposium.  The main
difference from 1.59 to 1.6 was a documentation update to include the new
API and function interfaces.  The tutorial was also modified slightly.
Release 1.6 also contained several minor fixes to the API and the following
minor fixes:

   * ''b is no longer an error.
   * Justify (x,0) is no longer an error (always returns '').
   * Fixed format(x,,n) when x is in exponential notation (the result did
     not always have n digits after the decimal point).
   * Allowed SYSTEM as a synonym for ENVIRONMENT in the value() call (for
     compatibility with Regina).
   * Changed value() not to apply REXX syntax to names in external pools.
     Environment variables are now restricted to contain REXX symbol
     characters except '.' and '$' and not to start with a digit, but
     they are not uppercased.
   * Fixed bug in value which made the returned string sometimes overwrite
     the new value of the variable.
   * Fixed bug with hashed function names.
   * B2x and x2b rewritten (previously they could return strings with extra
     leading zeros).
   * Fixed INTERPRET so that a syntax error during tokenisation is still
     caught by SIGNAL ON SYNTAX.
   * Fixed charin/linein to raise notready if given a write-only stream.
   * Fixed infinite loop error with INTERPRET "a=/*".

REXX/imc-beta-1.6b 4.00 7 Aug 1994

   * Fixed error where a file was left open after calling a function which
     was a Unix program.
   * Allowed "signal on syntax" to catch Emem and Esys errors.
   * Fixed wordpos() to check that the match ends on a word boundary
     (e.g. wordpos('foo','x foobar foo') is 3 and not 2).
   * Fixed error where memcpy() was used with overlapping arguments
   * Long echo instruction in Make changed to a <<"@EOF" redirection
     (the long echo instruction apparently choked the Linux shell).
   * Various twiddles for Linux, IRIX and HP-UX, including
     - FSTAT_FOR_CHARS preprocessor symbol added
     - RANLIB defined in makefile
     - I/O functions no longer call ftell before testing for an I/O error
     - twiddles to getwd, rand, srand, siginterrupt and vfork system calls
     - dictionary in rxmathfn.c kludged for IRIX.

REXX/imc-beta-1.6c 4.00 10 Aug 1995

   * Fixed silly file I/O bugs caused by the Linux twiddles:
     - "parse pull/linein" did not correctly detect I/O errors
     - some I/O functions would not record the error properly so that if
       "signal on notready" was executed without a "notready" label the
       I/O error would not appear in the traceback.
   * Protected RexxStart against a result parameter of NULL.
   * Changed which() not to rely on the value of dir->d_name after the
     directory has been closed.  Did a small number of other similar tweaks
     to fix minor problems detected by Mark Hessling using "Purify".
   * Ported to DEC Alpha.

REXX/imc-beta-1.6d 4.00 1 Aug 1996

   * Ported to Solaris 2.5 and FreeBSD 2.0.5.
   * Completely rehashed the installation procedure.
   * Fixed trace bug which causes compound symbol to have its first
     character inverted and one which fails to prevent control characters
     from being printed out when results are traced.
   * Slightly redid the order of includes at the top of each source file.

REXX/imc-beta-1.6d 4.00 9 Mar 1997

   * Fixed some trivial compile errors on Linux and Solaris 2.5 cc.  Added
     Solaris 2.5 cc to the Make file.

REXX/imc-beta-1.7 4.00 8 Feb 1999

   * Fixed intermittent segmentation fault bug in INTERPRET which only
     shows up on little-endian machines.
   * Fixed bug which sometimes causes INTERPRET "" to return from the
     current routine.
   * Fixed bug which sometimes causes weird effects when END is missing
     (like the error being reported at line 1880 in a 5-line program).
   * Made the interpreter report an error at the unmatched DO instruction
     instead of at end of program, when END is missing.
   * Fixed "Incomplete DO/SELECT/IF" reported inappropriately when END is
     the last line of the program or when "do;return;end" is given to the
     INTERPRET instruction.
   * Fixed occasional crash in "parse arg" instruction when there were no
     arguments.
   * Y2K fixes for DATE builtin function.
   * Removed illegal uses of errno symbol in structures (this caused
     compilation errors on Red Hat 5 and certain other systems).
   * Moved to getcwd and strerror instead of getwd and sys_errlist.
   * Used fd_set variables in rxque instead of old integer pointers.
   * Added time and date conversion, and 'O' option of TIME function.
   * Protected RexxStart against null value of rc.
   * Fixed crash when sending commands to the undefined environment.
   * If RexxStart called with an envname of NULL the default environment
     no longer starts with a dot.
   * When end-of-file was detected, stream(file,'d') would return
     "cannot assign requested address".
   * Format(-0.3,,0) was '-0', now just '0'.
   * Say '-9e999999999'<'9e999999999' was an error, now says '1'.
   * Implemented "expose" option.
   * Fixed bug where OPTIONS instruction sometimes failed to recognise options
     on little-endian architectures.
   * New STREAM commands:
     open write append|replace; open both [append|replace]; transient;
     persistent; query datetime|exists|handle|size|streamtype|timestamp.
   * Bug fixed (again) which prevented Rexx from working when invoked with
     descriptor 0 or 2 closed.
   * Implemented "sigpipe" option.  Tightened error checking in stream I/O
     to help detection of broken pipes.  Made "flush" stream command trigger
     NOTREADY on error.
   * Implemented "rxsaa:" token in .rxlib files.
   * Implemented RexxRegisterFunctionDll and RxFuncAdd/Drop/Query.
   * Made rexx search for filename without extension if filename.exec not
     found. 
   * Made which() function use access() if opendir fails (you can now put
     Rexx programs in unreadable directories).
   * Added #ifdef around the definition of filetype in const.h.
   * Allowed "stderr" and "stdout" as filespecs in the "tracefile=" option.
   * Allowed empty string as a valid stream for most functions.
   * Introduced REXXEXT environment variable; changed default extension
     to ".rexx".
   * Added APIENTRY to rexxsaa.h file.
   * Changed the default location of Rexx libraries from binary dir to
     library dir.
   * Wrote man pages for rexx, rxque, rxstack.

REXX/imc-beta-1.7 4.00 31 Mar 1999 (bugfix release)

   * Fixed time('O') for glibc and SysV systems.
   * Fixed segmentation fault on: rexx -tr -s "parse arg x"
   * Fixed compilation errors on FreeBSD.

REXX/imc-beta-1.75 4.00 1 Jan 2000 (unofficial bugfix release)

   * Fixed value length error in RexxVariablePool API function.
   * Compiled on Red Hat 6 / glibc 2.1 (stderr not necessarily constant).
   * Fixed memory corruption occuring rarely in DO loops.
   * Fixed numeric comparison ('say 0 & -1<1' said -1 due to a spurious
     stacked item when the signs differ - bug introduced in 8 Feb release).
   * Fixed date('B',x) (returned wrong answer for x <= 31-Dec-1969).
   * Fixed date(y,x,'B') (returned error for x < 719162).
   * Doc fix: d2b and b2d are not standard functions.
   * Fixed 'query exists' stream function (returned wrong result for
     the file '/' or '/foo').
   * Symbol fixes: value(x) did not allow x to be a number in exponential
     format; value(x,y) did allow x to be a constant symbol; symbol(x) no
     longer allows x to contain a leading sign or leading and trailing spaces;
     datatype(x,'S') changed to test x against the syntax of a symbol
     instead of just testing the individual characters of x.

REXX/imc-beta-1.76 4.00 25 Feb 2002 (another unofficial bugfix release)

   * set LD=gcc in the Make file for Linux (fixes bad crash with glibc>=2.1).
   * clear workspace in main interpreter loop (fixes potential memory leak).
   * fix off-by-1 memory allocation in signal condition (causes occasional
     bad crashes).
   * fix invalid array access in rare case of traceput called with
     an empty string.
   * fix rare PARSE VALUE bug which corrupts the expression being parsed.
   * PARSE bug with arbitrary expressions in template documented.
   * assignments during parse traced with >=> tag.
   * sign() function documented.
