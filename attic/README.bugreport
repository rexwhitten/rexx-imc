I will be happy to receive all bug reports or questions about REXX/imc at

                           imc@comlab.ox.ac.uk

Please try to pinpoint any fault as accurately as possible, for instance by
making a copy of the program that caused the fault and deleting all
unnecessary lines.  Mail me a trace (using, for example, "trace r") which
will enable me to reproduce the fault, together with a description of the
fault.
